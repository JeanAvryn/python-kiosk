                    <p>It was founded in July 1966 through a municipal council of Cuyapo. The first
                        petitioners on the grant of the establishment of the school were a group of elementary
                        teachers of San Antonio Elementary School led by Severina Santero, Crispino Pineda, Leoncio Meemita,
                        Arnulfo Mangabat Sr., Purificacion Evangelista, Emilio Jose, Magdalena Jose, and Petra Gajeton
                        who had filed the resolution of the then 1st secondary school in Cuyapo Municipal Council.
